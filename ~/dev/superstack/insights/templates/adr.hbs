# Architecture Decision Record: {{title}}

## Document Information
**ADR ID**: {{adrId}}  
**Status**: {{status}} *(Proposed/Accepted/Rejected/Deprecated/Superseded)*  
**Author**: {{author}}  
**Date**: {{date 'YYYY-MM-DD'}}  
**Supersedes**: {{supersedes}}  
**Superseded by**: {{supersededBy}}  

## Context

{{#if context}}
{{context}}
{{else}}
*Describe the issue or problem statement that this decision addresses. Include relevant constraints (technical, business, regulatory, etc.) and any external factors influencing the decision. What brought us to this point?*

*Example: Our application currently handles user authentication directly, storing credentials in our database. As we scale, we need a more robust approach to user identity and access management that supports additional authentication methods, improves security, and reduces development overhead.*
{{/if}}

## Decision

{{#if decision}}
{{decision}}
{{else}}
**We will: *[concise statement of the decision]***

*Provide a clear statement of the decision made. Be specific about what was chosen and what was explicitly not chosen. This should be a relatively brief but precise description.*

*Example: We will implement OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect for authentication and authorization using Auth0 as our identity provider. We will migrate our existing users to this system over a period of 3 months while maintaining backward compatibility.*
{{/if}}
