{{CONTEXT}}

## Storage Needs
- File types and sizes
- Access patterns (public/private)
- Upload/download workflows
- File management

## Expected Implementation
Please provide:

1. **Storage Configuration:**
   - Bucket setup and configuration
   - Storage policies
   - File organization strategy

2. **User Interface Components:**
   - File upload component
   - File browser/gallery
   - Progress indicators
   - Preview functionality

3. **Backend Implementation:**
   - Server-side validation and processing
   - Access control implementation
   - Webhook integration (if needed)

4. **Security Considerations:**
   - Access policies
   - Content validation
   - Size limitations
   - File type restrictions

Please structure your response with TypeScript code examples that I can directly implement in my Next.js + Supabase project, including both client and server components where appropriate.
