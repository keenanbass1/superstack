## Project Context
{{CONTEXT}}

## Database Schema

{{SCHEMA}}
```

## Query Constraints
- Security considerations (Row Level Security)
- Performance requirements
- Data validation needs

## Expected Behavior
Please provide:

1. **Supabase Query Implementation:**
   - Properly typed TypeScript implementation using Supabase JS client
   - Optimized for performance
   - Error handling and edge cases addressed

2. **Security Considerations:**
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policy recommendations
   - Authentication requirements
   - Data access patterns

3. **Client Implementation:**
   - How to integrate this query with React components
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Optimistic updates if applicable

4. **Testing Strategy:**
   - Suggested test cases
   - Mocking approach for testing

Please structure your response with code examples that I can directly implement in my Next.js + Supabase project.
