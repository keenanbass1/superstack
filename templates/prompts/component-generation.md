Please generate a React component based on the description above. Consider:

1. **Component Structure**
   - Functional component with hooks
   - Props with TypeScript interfaces
   - Proper state management

2. **UI/UX Considerations**
   - Clean, accessible design
   - Responsive behavior
   - Loading/error states
   - User interaction handling

3. **Styling Approach**
   - CSS/SCSS/Tailwind as appropriate
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Theme integration (if applicable)

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Memoization where appropriate
   - Efficient rendering strategies
   - Lazy loading as needed

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Key test cases to consider
   - Edge cases and user scenarios

Please provide the complete component implementation with any necessary imports and supporting code. Include examples of how the component would be used in a parent component.

I'm using the Superstack development workflow system and will be integrating this into my existing React project.
