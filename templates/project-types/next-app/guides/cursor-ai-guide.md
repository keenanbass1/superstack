# Using Cursor AI with Your Next.js Application

This guide explains how to leverage Cursor AI to enhance your development workflow when working with Next.js applications created using the Superstack template.

## What is Cursor?

[Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) is a code editor built on VSCode that integrates powerful AI capabilities. It allows you to chat with AI about your code, generate new code, and get explanationsâ€”all directly within your editor.

## Setting Up Your Project with Cursor

### Installation & Setup

1. **Install Cursor**: Download and install from [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh/)

2. **Open Your Project**:
   ```
   File > Open Folder > [Select your Next.js project folder]
   ```

3. **Configure Cursor**:
   - Open settings (Ctrl+, or Cmd+,)
   - Set up any custom configurations
   - Ensure TypeScript and ESLint integration are enabled

## Leveraging AI Context

The Superstack template includes a `project-context.md` file specifically designed to give AI assistants (like Cursor) better understanding of your project.

### Using Project Context in Cursor

1. **Open the Context File**:
   ```
   [Your Project]/project-context.md
   ```

2. **Make Sure It's Updated**:
   - Fill in all placeholders with actual project information
   - Add specific details about project goals, architecture, and conventions

3. **Share with Cursor AI**:
   - Select all text in the context file (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A)
   - Use Cursor's AI panel (Ctrl+Shift+L or Cmd+Shift+L)
   - Prompt: "Please read this project context to understand my project better"

4. **Reference in Future Questions**:
   - Start questions with "Based on my project context..."
   - Refer to specific aspects described in the context

## AI-Assisted Coding Patterns

### Component Creation

1. **Generate a New Component**:
   ```
   [Create a new file in src/components/ui/]
   
   Prompt: "Create a TypeScript React component for a [describe component] 
   that follows our project's TypeScript and Tailwind conventions."
   ```

2. **Enhance Existing Components**:
   ```
   [Open component file]
   
   Prompt: "Add [feature] to this component while maintaining our styling 
   approach and TypeScript type safety."
   ```

### Adding Functionality

1. **Implement Hooks**:
   ```
   Prompt: "Create a custom React hook that [describe functionality] 
   with proper TypeScript typing and error handling."
   ```

2. **API Integration**:
   ```
   Prompt: "Help me implement a function to fetch data from [API] 
   and integrate it with our existing components."
   ```

## Effective Prompting Techniques

### Using Superstack Prompt Templates

The Superstack system includes prompt templates in `superstack/templates/prompts/`. You can leverage these for better results:

1. **Code Review**:
   ```
   [Open file to review]
   
   Prompt: "Please perform a code review on this file following these 
   criteria: [Copy relevant sections from code-review.md]"
   ```

2. **Problem Solving**:
   ```
   Prompt: "I need to solve a problem: [describe issue]. 
   Approach it using this structure: [Copy structure from problem-solving.md]"
   ```

### Project-Specific Prompting

For best results with Cursor AI:

1. **Be specific about project constraints**:
   ```
   "Given that we're using Next.js App Router with TypeScript and 
   Tailwind CSS, how should I implement..."
   ```

2. **Reference existing patterns**:
   ```
   "Following the pattern used in our Button.tsx component, 
   create a similar approach for..."
   ```

3. **Mention file locations**:
   ```
   "I need to modify the component at src/components/ui/Header.tsx 
   to add a dropdown menu that..."
   ```

## Common Development Tasks

### Navigation & Routing

```
Prompt: "Help me implement a navigation system using Next.js App 
Router that includes these routes: [list routes]"
```

### Data Fetching

```
Prompt: "Show me how to implement server-side data fetching for 
this page component using Next.js best practices"
```

### Form Handling

```
Prompt: "Create a form component with validation for [describe fields] 
that submits to our API endpoint"
```

### State Management

```
Prompt: "What's the best way to manage global state in our Next.js 
application for [describe state needs]?"
```

## Workflow Integration

### Using AI with Git

1. **Commit Message Generation**:
   ```
   [After making changes]
   
   Prompt: "Based on the changes I've made, suggest a descriptive 
   commit message following conventional commit format"
   ```

2. **Code Review Before Commit**:
   ```
   Prompt: "Review the changes I've made in [file] to ensure they 
   meet our project standards before I commit"
   ```

### Documentation Generation

1. **Component Documentation**:
   ```
   [Open component file]
   
   Prompt: "Generate comprehensive JSDoc comments for this component 
   including all props and usage examples"
   ```

2. **README Updates**:
   ```
   Prompt: "Update our README to include documentation for the new 
   [feature] I've just implemented"
   ```

## Debugging Assistance

1. **Error Analysis**:
   ```
   [Copy error message]
   
   Prompt: "I'm getting this error in our Next.js application. 
   What might be causing it and how can I fix it?"
   ```

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   ```
   Prompt: "Review this component for performance issues and suggest 
   optimizations for rendering efficiency"
   ```

## Advanced Techniques

### AI-Assisted Refactoring

```
Prompt: "Refactor this component to split it into smaller, more 
manageable components while maintaining the same functionality"
```

### Migration Assistance

```
Prompt: "Help me migrate this code from [old pattern] to [new pattern] 
following Next.js best practices"
```

### Test Generation

```
Prompt: "Generate Jest tests for this component covering all the 
main functionality and edge cases"
```
