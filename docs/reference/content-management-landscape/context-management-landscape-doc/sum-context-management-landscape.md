I've completed the comprehensive analysis of context management and structuring strategies for large language models. This research analyzes the landscape of approaches for authoring, storing, composing, and delivering context to LLMs with a focus on practical implementation strategies.
The analysis covers:

Conceptual Foundations

Detailed explanation of what "context" means in LLM systems
The importance of effective context management
Tradeoffs between large and small context windows


Context Structuring Strategies

Comparison of flat document vs. modular approaches
Various prioritization techniques (token budgets, MCP priorities)
Advanced chunking, summarization, and retrieval methods
Approaches to context composition and orchestration


Best Practices and Implementation Patterns

File organization models (topic-based, functional, granularity-based)
Metadata and tagging systems for context modules
Detailed analysis of RAG frameworks and implementations
Comparison of embedding-based and rule-based selection


Tradeoffs and Design Considerations

Performance vs. flexibility tradeoffs
Reusability vs. specificity in context modules
Manual curation vs. automated generation approaches
Hybrid strategies that balance these considerations


Anti-Patterns and Common Pitfalls

Monolithic context blocks without prioritization
Including redundant or low-value information
Uncontrolled token growth in conversations
Ignoring model attention behaviors
Failing to update stale context


Model-Specific Insights

Differences between GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Llama models
Strategies for addressing recency bias and attention decay
Format optimizations for different model architectures


Practical Examples

Before/after examples for financial advisor and technical documentation assistant systems
Detailed implementations showing the impact of proper context management



Throughout the analysis, I've included code examples to demonstrate practical implementation patterns and highlighted the importance of balancing various concerns when designing context management systems.
The research concludes that there is no single "correct" approach to context management, but rather a set of principles and strategies that should be applied based on specific use cases, with an emphasis on modular design, proper prioritization, model-aware formatting, and continuous evolution of context systems.
