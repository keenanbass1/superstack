- Helps identify patterns and insights

### Project Templates

Start new projects quickly with:

- Pre-configured templates for different project types
- Standardized file structures and best practices
- Integrated testing and documentation setup
- AI-ready context templates

## üß© Core Workflows

### Starting a New Project

```bash
# Create a new project
dev new awesome-app

# Initialize the project context
dev context init

# Start a development session
dev log start "Initial setup"
```

### Daily Development

```bash
# Start your development session
dev log start "Working on user authentication"

# Get AI help with a problem
dev ai solve "How to implement token refresh"

# Add notes as you work
dev log note "Discovered issue with token expiration"

# Generate a component
dev ai generate component --description="Login form with validation"

# End your session
dev log end --summary
```

## üß† Working with AI

### Context Preparation

The key to getting good results from AI is providing good context:

1. Run `dev context init` to create your project context
2. Edit the context file to add specific details about your project
3. Run `dev context push` before working with AI

### Effective AI Prompting

- **Be specific** about what you're trying to achieve
- **Include relevant constraints** or requirements
- **Mention technologies** you're using
- **Provide examples** when possible

### Using AI Responses

AI responses are copied to your clipboard or saved to files:

1. Review suggestions carefully
2. Adapt them to your specific needs
3. Test thoroughly before committing
4. Save useful responses to your project's documentation
