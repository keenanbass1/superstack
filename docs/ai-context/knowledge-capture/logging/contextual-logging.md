## Capturing Context Effectively

### 1. Context Templates

Use standardized templates to ensure consistent context capture:

```markdown
# Development Context

## Technical Environment
- **Languages**: TypeScript 4.9.5, CSS/SCSS
- **Frameworks**: React 18.2.0, Material UI 5.11.8
- **Tools**: VS Code, Webpack 5.75.0, ESLint 8.33.0
- **Environment**: Local development on Windows 11

## Project Status
- **Sprint**: 7 of 10
- **Project Phase**: Beta Development
- **Key Metrics**: Performance optimization (target: 15% improvement)

## Current Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Performance is the top priority
- No new dependencies allowed without approval

## Historical Context
- Previous implementation attempt failed (see log 2025-03-15)
- Architecture decision to use micro-frontends (ADR #12)
- Recently migrated from Redux to Context API
```

### 2. Automated Context Collection

Use scripts and tools to automatically gather context:

```javascript
// Example script to generate a context template with auto-filled data
async function generateContextTemplate() {
  const gitBranch = execSync('git branch --show-current').toString().trim();
  const packageJson = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('package.json', 'utf8'));
  const recentCommits = execSync('git log -5 --pretty=format:"%h %s"').toString().split('\n');
  
  // Get environment info
  const nodeVersion = process.version;
  const os = require('os');
  const osInfo = `${os.type()} ${os.release()}`;
  
  return `# Development Context (Auto-generated)

## Technical Environment
- **Project**: ${packageJson.name} (${packageJson.version})
- **Current Branch**: ${gitBranch}
- **Node Version**: ${nodeVersion}
- **Operating System**: ${osInfo}
- **Key Dependencies**:
${Object.entries(packageJson.dependencies)
  .map(([name, version]) => `  - ${name}: ${version}`)
  .join('\n')}

## Recent Activity
${recentCommits.map(commit => `- ${commit}`).join('\n')}

## Related Issues
<!-- Automatically find issues mentioned in recent commits -->
${findIssuesFromCommits(recentCommits).map(issue => `- #${issue}`).join('\n')}

<!-- Add your manual context below this line -->
`;
}
```

### 3. Progressive Context

Start with essential context and add more as needed:

```markdown
# Initial Context (Start of Task)
- Working on user profile page performance
- Current load time: 3.2s (target: < 1.5s)
- Using React with Redux, Material UI components
- Profile data from REST API, averaging 120KB payload

# Updated Context (After Investigation)
- Discovered 70% of load time is from unoptimized images
- Image CDN supports responsive image parameters
- Browser profiling shows excessive re-renders
- Redux state normalized incorrectly causing component updates

# Final Context (After Implementation)
- Implemented responsive images with srcset and sizes
- Added React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Restructured Redux state for profile components
- Final load time: 1.3s (59% improvement)
```

## Context for Different Log Types

### 1. Bug Investigation Logs

Essential context for debugging activities:

```yaml
bug_context:
  issue_id: "#432"

```

## Balancing Detail and Utility

Finding the right level of context to include:

### 1. Too Little Context

```markdown
# April 10 Log

Fixed the login bug. It was a timing issue. Had to add a delay.

Added the new feature for profile pages. Works correctly now.

Had issues with webpack but figured it out.
```

Problems:
- No technical specifics
- No reasoning behind solutions
- No information about alternatives
- No links to related resources
- Future developers learn nothing

### 2. Excessive Context

```markdown
# April 10 Development Log - Authentication System Bug Investigation and Resolution - Final Version - Jane Smith

## Detailed Technical Context
- Platform: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (10.0, Build 19044) (19041.vb_release.191206-1406)
- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz (12 CPUs), ~2.6GHz
- Memory: 32768MB RAM
- Node Version: v14.17.0
- NPM Version: 6.14.13
- Git Version: git version 2.30.1.windows.1
- VS Code Version: 1.65.2 (user setup)
- VS Code Extensions: 37 extensions including ESLint v2.2.6, Prettier v9.9.0
- Chrome Version: 100.0.4896.75 (Official Build) (64-bit)
- Internet Connection: Fiber optic, 300Mbps download, 150Mbps upload

[... 50 more lines of environment details ...]

## Issue Being Addressed
The authentication system has a bug where users are occasionally logged out...

[... continues for many more pages with excessive detail ...]
```

Problems:
- Too verbose to be practically useful
- Important information buried in details
- Time-consuming to write and read
- Analysis paralysis from too much information

### 3. Balanced, Useful Context

```markdown
# Development Log: 2025-04-10

## Context
- **Project**: User Authentication System
- **Task**: Fix intermittent logout issue (#432)
- **Environment**: Production (v2.5.3)
- **Impact**: ~2% of users affected during peak hours

## Issue Summary
Users are randomly logged out during session, primarily during high traffic periods. JWT tokens are valid but application behaves as if they're expired.

## Investigation
- Analyzed server logs during occurrences - no backend errors
- Reproduced in development by simulating network latency
- Identified race condition between token refresh and API calls
- Front-end treating 401s incorrectly during refresh window

## Solution
- Implemented token refresh queue to prevent concurrent refresh attempts
- Added 5-second grace period for "expired" tokens during refresh
- Updated error handling to retry requests with new token
- Added detailed logging of token lifecycle events

## Validation
- Load tested with 2,000 simulated users at 200 req/sec
- No logout issues observed in 24-hour test
- Deployed to staging for further validation

## Learning
- JWT handling had subtle issues with concurrent requests
- Need more comprehensive token management strategy
- Created knowledge base article on token refresh patterns
```

This balanced approach:
- Includes essential details without overwhelming
- Provides enough context for future understanding
- Captures key learnings
- Is structured for both human and machine reading
- Takes reasonable time to create and consume

## AI-Optimized Context

To make context especially valuable for AI analysis:

### 1. Explicit Connections

Make relationships between concepts explicit:

```yaml
connections:
  - from: "JWT refresh mechanism"
    to: "Rate limiting system"
    relationship: "affects"
    description: "JWT refreshes count against rate limits"
  
  - from: "User password change"
    to: "Active JWT tokens"
    relationship: "invalidates"
    description: "Security policy requires token revocation on password change"
  
  - from: "Authentication service"
    to: "Product catalog"
    relationship: "provides data for"
    description: "User preferences determine product visibility"
```

### 2. Questions and Hypotheses

Document open questions and working theories:

```markdown
## Open Questions
- How do we handle token refresh for multiple tabs? 
  - **Hypothesis**: LocalStorage events might help coordinate
  - **Status**: Unverified, needs research
  
- Does token size affect performance significantly?
  - **Hypothesis**: Large tokens (>1KB) may impact request time
  - **Status**: Partially tested, initial results suggest minimal impact
  
- Can we completely eliminate server-side session state?
  - **Hypothesis**: Not for enterprise customers due to compliance requirements
  - **Status**: Confirmed by legal team
```

### 3. Cross-Domain Insights

Capture connections between technical and non-technical domains:

```markdown
## Cross-Domain Factors

**Technical ↔ Business**
- Token expiration time affects both security posture and user experience
- Shorter times improve security but increase frustration
- Current 4-hour expiration is a compromise based on user behavior analytics

**Technical ↔ Legal**
- GDPR requirements dictate how authentication data is stored and processed
- Compliance requires certain user consent workflows in authentication

**Technical ↔ UX**
- Auth failures must be communicated clearly without technical jargon
- UX research shows users often blame themselves for auth errors
```

### 4. Confidence Levels

Indicate certainty of information and decisions:

```markdown
## Implementation Approach

- Use refresh tokens with JWT (Confidence: High)
  - Well-established pattern with good security properties
  - Team has previous experience implementing this approach
  
- Store tokens in HttpOnly cookies (Confidence: Medium)
  - Protects against XSS but has limitations with mobile apps
  - May need to revisit for React Native integration
  
- Implement PKCE for authorization code flow (Confidence: Low)
  - Team has limited experience with this approach
  - Research suggests benefits for our use case but needs validation
```

By capturing rich, structured context in development logs, you create a valuable knowledge asset that enables better decision-making, more effective problem-solving, and continuous improvement over time.
