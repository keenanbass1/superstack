# Context Module Development Workflow

This guide outlines the comprehensive workflow for creating high-quality AI context modules. It provides a structured approach to ensure that each module effectively captures domain knowledge in a format that maximizes AI tool effectiveness.

## Workflow Overview

The context module development process consists of four main phases:
