# Context Module Development Workflow

This guide outlines the comprehensive workflow for creating high-quality AI context modules optimized for Model Context Protocol (MCP) compatibility. It provides a structured approach to ensure that each module effectively captures domain knowledge in a format that maximizes AI tool effectiveness.

## Workflow Overview

The context module development process consists of four main phases:

## Adapting the Workflow

This workflow should evolve based on prompt engineering advances and model capabilities:

### For Simple Concepts

For straightforward concepts, you might streamline the process by:
- Focusing on core principles and implementation patterns
- Using fewer context chunks
- Combining related sections into larger chunks

### For Complex Domains

For more complex topics, consider expanding the process:
- Creating more granular context chunks
- Adding more explicit reasoning steps
- Enhancing decision trees with more branching options
- Providing more diverse examples

### For Rapidly Evolving Areas

For topics that change frequently:
- Note version or date dependencies clearly
- Include model version considerations
- Document alternative approaches
- Plan for more frequent review cycles

## Continuous Workflow Improvement

The workflow itself should be periodically reviewed:

1. **Quarterly Review**
   - Evaluate module effectiveness data
   - Update workflow based on feedback
   - Incorporate new prompt engineering techniques

2. **AI Tool Evolution**
   - Adapt to changes in MCP specifications
   - Update for new model capabilities
   - Refine testing approaches for new models

3. **Efficiency Enhancements**
   - Create templates with MCP structure built in
   - Develop automated validation tools
   - Create standard patterns for common module types
