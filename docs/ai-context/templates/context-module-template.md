   - [Question to consider]
   - [Another question]
   - [Additional consideration]

2. **[Decision Step 2]**
   - [Question to consider]
   - [Another question]
   - [Additional consideration]

3. **[Decision Step 3]**
   - [Question to consider]
   - [Another question]
   - [Additional consideration]

4. **[Decision Step 4]**
   - [Question to consider]
   - [Another question]
   - [Additional consideration]
