# 🚀 SUPERSTACK: AI-Augmented Developer Workflow System

> A comprehensive meta-development framework designed to accelerate your workflow, preserve knowledge, and leverage AI throughout the development lifecycle.

## 🌟 Overview

Superstack is a self-evolving developer workflow system that integrates AI at every step of the development process. It creates a consistent, reproducible environment while continuously improving through insights gathered during daily work.

By combining thoughtful structure, automation, and context-aware AI assistance, Superstack transforms how you build software - reducing cognitive load while amplifying your capabilities.

## 🧩 Core Components

- **Context Management** - Store, retrieve and inject rich project context into AI models
- **Knowledge Capture** - Record insights, decisions, and solutions for future reference
- **Custom CLI (`dev`)** - Unified command-line interface for all workflow operations
- **Template Library** - Reusable code, project scaffolding, and documentation templates
- **AI Integration Layer** - Standardized interfaces to multiple AI models
- **Automation Framework** - Scripts and tools that eliminate repetitive tasks
- **DSP Optimization System** - Automatically optimize AI context modules using Demonstration-Supervised Program synthesis
- **Testing Framework** - Systematic testing of context modules for quality and consistency

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Setting Up Your Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/superstack.git ~/dev/superstack

# Install dependencies
cd ~/dev/superstack/scripts
./setup-system.sh

# Build and install the CLI
cd dev
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Initialize a new project
dev new my-project --template=next-app

# Update AI context
dev context push

# Start a development log
dev log start "Implementing user authentication"

# Get AI assistance on a task
dev ai solve "Create a pagination component"

# Optimize AI context modules
dev context optimize --module state_management
```

## 🧠 Philosophy

Superstack is built on these core principles:

- **Context is king** - Rich context enables better AI assistance and future understanding
- **Knowledge persistence** - Never solve the same problem twice
- **Progressive enhancement** - Start simple, add complexity only when needed
- **Measurable improvement** - Track metrics to ensure the system delivers value
- **Self-evolution** - The system should learn and improve through its own usage
- **Continuous optimization** - Automatically refine and enhance context modules

## 🔄 Workflow Lifecycle

1. **Project Initialization** - Bootstrap with templates and context
2. **Development Loop** - Code with AI assistance, capturing context updates
3. **Knowledge Capture** - Log decisions, solutions, and insights
4. **Context Optimization** - Optimize modules for token efficiency and effectiveness
5. **Retrospective** - Extract patterns and improvements
6. **System Evolution** - Enhance templates, scripts, and processes

## 🔧 Customization

Superstack is designed to be customized to your specific needs:

- Add new templates in `templates/project-types/`
- Create custom prompt templates in `templates/prompts/`
- Extend the CLI with new commands in `scripts/dev/src/commands/`
- Configure your editor and shell settings in `config/`
- Customize optimization strategies in `config/dsp_config.yaml`

## 📊 Measuring Effectiveness

Track your improvements with:

- Time saved through automation
- Successful vs. unsuccessful AI interactions
- Knowledge reuse frequency
- Context quality metrics
- Token usage optimization rates
- Module feedback scores

## 🧪 Advanced Features

### DSP Context Module Optimization

The system includes a DSPy-based optimization framework that:
- Automatically analyzes and improves context modules
- Reduces token usage while preserving information
- Evaluates optimizations against quantifiable metrics
- Integrates with CI/CD for automated improvements
- Collects and analyzes user feedback

Documentation: [DSP Optimization System](docs/ai-context/dsp-optimization.md)

### Context Module Testing

The system provides a comprehensive testing framework for context modules:
- PromptFoo integration for evaluating context modules
- Automated test execution via CLI or CI/CD pipeline
- Module-specific test configurations
- Predefined assertions and expected outputs
- Test reporting and result visualization
- Supports both individual module and full system testing

Documentation: [Testing Guide](TESTING-GUIDE.md#context-module-testing)

## 🤝 Contributing
